## Overview

This is a 100% responsive Fullstack application using Next.js where you can interact with the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to search for characters or movies and see their details.

## Tech stack

I used Next.js, React, Typescript, Tailwind, Firebase, Jest, React Testing Library, React Icons and Node.js

## Running the project

To run the development version, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
Then create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`
`FIREBASE_CONFIG_API_KEY=AIzaSyAmSZde2XjBfsM0LMSB5GXJQ2LCgxojLOw`

Then you should be able to run `npm run dev` to initialize the development version.
